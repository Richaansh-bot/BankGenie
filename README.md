## BankGenie

BankGenie is a web application that helps users analyze their spending, saving, and investment behavior based on their bank statements. Users can upload their bank statement and get detailed insights about their financial transactions.

The application leverages OpenAI APIs to extract meaning from text and analyze transaction descriptions, which can sometimes be ambiguous or difficult to understand. This allows the application to generate summaries of the data, answer questions about the data, and predict future behavior based on past data.

The application is built using Python and Django on the backend, and React on the frontend. The backend processes the bank statement data and makes use of several tools, such as PolarDB, to handle the large amounts of data. The frontend provides a user-friendly interface for users to interact with the application and view the insights generated.

Some of the key features of BankGenie include:
